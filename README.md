## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Nu-Metal-Pose-Random-Image-Detector! This application allows you to use your webcam for real-time gesture detection. When the software sees two open hands on your screen, it will overlay a random image from a local folder onto your video feed. Below, you'll find instructions to download and run the software easily.

   Ensure your webcam is connected and permission is granted for the application to access it. You may see a prompt asking for permission on first launch.

5. **Select Image Folder**

   Choose a folder on your computer that contains images you want to overlay. Make sure the images are in a commonly used format, like .jpg or .png.

6. **Start Detecting Gestures**

   Stand in front of the webcam and put your hands up, open and facing towards the camera. The software will detect this gesture and overlay a random image from the selected folder onto your video.

## 🎨 Customization

- You can add more images to the selected folder at any time. These images will be included in the random selection.
- Change the image folder by going into the app settings and specifying a new path.

## 📌 Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Not Detected:** Ensure your webcam is working with other applications. Check your privacy settings to confirm the app has access to the webcam.
- **Performance Issues:** Make sure no other high-resource applications are running. Close any unnecessary programs and try again.
- **Image Not Overlaying:** Check that you are making the correct gesture as described. If the gesture does not appear to be recognized, try adjusting your lighting or webcam position.
