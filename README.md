## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Nu-Metal-Pose-Random-Image-Detector! This application allows you to use your webcam for real-time gesture detection.

Below, you'll find instructions to download and run the software easily.

## 🎨 Customization

- Change the image folder by going into the app settings and specifying a new path.

## 📌 Troubleshooting

- **Webcam Not Detected:** Ensure your webcam is working with other applications. Check your privacy settings to confirm the app has access to the webcam.
- **Performance Issues:** Make sure no other high-resource applications are running. Close any unnecessary programs and try again.
- **Image Not Overlaying:** Check that you are making the correct gesture as described. If the gesture does not appear to be recognized, try adjusting your lighting or webcam position.
